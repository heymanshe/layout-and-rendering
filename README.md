 # Overview

- This guide explains the interaction between the Controller and View in the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture of Rails.

## Key Points

- **Controller's Role** Manages request handling and delegates complex operations to the Model.

- **View's Role**: Responsible for rendering the response to the user.

- **Handoff Process**: The Controller determines what to send as a response and calls an appropriate method to generate it.

- **View Rendering**:

  - Rails wraps views in a layout.

  - It may also include partial views for modularity.

- **Full-Blown Views**: When rendering a complete view, Rails manages additional processes like layout application and partial inclusion.
